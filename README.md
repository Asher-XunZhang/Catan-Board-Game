## The Game:

Catan is a board game for 3 to 4 players. Players build settlements on the randomly generated hexagonal board, 
and receive resources based on their settlement
location and the roll of the dice. Players attempt to gather resources through settlements and trading, accumulating 
victory points along the way. The first player to 10 victory points wins.

## Our Game vs Standard Catan:

The version we have created here is slightly different than the standard Catan. Namely, we have not implemented development
cards or the robber. These features make the game more interesting, but we were unable to fully implement them due to their
complexity. The adjacent settlement rule is also only enforced for each player i.e. a player cannot create adjacent settlements
but other players (the computer) can build settlements adjacent to that settlement. Players can also build settlements 
independent of road placements, unlike standard Catan.

## How to play:

At the start of the game, all players place two settlements to start. Players place settlements on the corners of hexes.
Players will receive resources based the number on the hexes surrounding the settlement, regardless of who rolled the dice. 
Players can then trade these 
resources through the trade menu or build new settlements. Players can also upgrade settlements to cities, which provide 
2 resources instead 1 every time their hexes are rolled. Players get 1 victory point for every settlement and 2 for every
city. The first player to 10 victory points wins.
